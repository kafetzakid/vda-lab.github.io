This post is part of a collection for our students in "Managing Large Omics Datasets" (I0U19A) at the KU Leuven. In this exercise, we will perform queries on a MongoDB database that has been populated with the beer dataset.

## Preparation
As with the Hadoop exercises, weâ€™ll use Docker containers. See [this blog post with the hadoop exercise](http://vda-lab.github.io/2016/04/hadoop-tutorial) for a refresher.

To run, type `docker run -d -p 27017:27017 jandot/mongo-i0u19a`, and then:

* if you have the mongo client locally: `mongo --host 192.168.99.100`
* if you don't: `docker run -it --rm jandot/mongo-i0u19a /bin/bash`, and then `mongo --host 192.168.99.100`

In case you're running this on a linux machine, you can remove the `--host 192.168.99.100` part.

## 1. Simple Queries using the Mongo Shell
In doing these exercises, please refer to the MongoDB documentation at the following sites:

* [http://docs.mongodb.org/getting-started/shell/client/](http://docs.mongodb.org/getting-started/shell/client/)
* [http://docs.mongodb.org/getting-started/shell/insert/](http://docs.mongodb.org/getting-started/shell/insert/)
* [http://docs.mongodb.org/getting-started/shell/query/](http://docs.mongodb.org/getting-started/shell/query/)
* [http://docs.mongodb.org/getting-started/shell/update/](http://docs.mongodb.org/getting-started/shell/update/)
* [http://docs.mongodb.org/getting-started/shell/remove/](http://docs.mongodb.org/getting-started/shell/remove/)
* [http://docs.mongodb.org/getting-started/shell/aggregation/](http://docs.mongodb.org/getting-started/shell/aggregation/)
* [http://docs.mongodb.org/getting-started/shell/indexes/](http://docs.mongodb.org/getting-started/shell/indexes/)

Connect to the mongoDB instance using the `mongo` shell as indicated above.

    Jans-MacBook-Air-2:~ jaerts$ mongo --host 192.168.99.100
    MongoDB shell version: 3.0.4
    connecting to: 192.168.99.100:27017/test
    >

You now get the MongoDB prompt in which we will work. At the end, you can escape the MongoDB shell by typing exit. Type

    > show dbs

to know what databases are available. Connect to the database for this exercise:

    > use i0u19a

The command

    > show collections

returns the list of collections ("tables") that are stored in the collection

To exit the MongoDB shell and return to your linux prompt, use

    > quit()

Now what does the data look like? Each document covers a single beer. Let's check what a document looks like:

    > db.beers.findOne()

The output shows us that one beer can have more than one type, for example.

    {
    	"_id" : ObjectId("57193db714ab80806edea386"),
    	"beer" : "Postel Tripel",
    	"brewery" : "Affligem Brouwerij",
    	"type" : [
    		"blonde tripel",
    		"abdijbier"
    	],
    	"alcoholpercentage" : 8.5
    }


### Exercises

To get out feet wet, we'll first try some very simple queries. Using the `beers` collection:

* How many beers are there in the database?
<!-- db.beers.count() -->
* Return the first 5 beers.
<!-- db.beers.find().limit(5) -->
* How many beers in the database are of type "blond troebel"?
<!-- db.beers.find({type:"blond troebel"}).count() -->
* Of these "blond troebel" beers, only return the name of the beer.
<!-- db.beers.find({type:"blond troebel"},{beer:1}) -->
* How many beers have a percentage alcohol of more than 8 degrees?
<!-- db.beers.find({alcoholpercentage: {$gt: 8}}).count() -->
* How many beers have low alcohol ("alcoholarm")?
<!-- db.beers.find({type: "alcoholarm"}).count() -->

## 2. Aggregate in MongoDB

It is possible in MongoDB to create pipelines to process data while querying by sending a stream of data through a list of commands, similar to how you would write a pipeline on the linux command line. This comes in very handy when wanting to aggregate data. Specific commands that you can use include (but are not limited to):

* `$project`: reshape each document
* `$match`: filter the stream
* `$limit`: return only the first *n* documents
* `$unwind`: deconstruct a list in each document into separate documents
* `$group`: group documents by a given identifier
* `$sample`: take a random sample
* `$out`: write the results to a new collection. If used, this should be the last step of the pipeline.

For a full list of commands to use in aggregation in MongoDB, see [https://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/operator/aggregation-pipeline/](https://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/operator/aggregation-pipeline/)

A full list of accumulators for `$group` can be found here: [https://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/group/](https://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/group/), and includes `$sum`, `$avg`, `$max`, `$min` and others.

These commands can be combined in different ways to alter the stream as it passes through them. For example, let's select those beers that have a percentage of more than 8 degrees, get the average of these per brewery, and finally take a sample.

```javascript
db.beers.aggregate([
  {$match: {alcoholpercentage: {$gt: 8}}},
  {$group: {_id: "$brewery", avg: {$avg: "$alcoholpercentage"}}},
  {$sample: {size: 5}}
])
```

The output of this command looks like this:
```
{ "_id" : "Brouwerij De Graal voor t'Drankorgel", "avg" : 8.3 }
{ "_id" : "Brasserie Saint Feuillien", "avg" : 9.5 }
{ "_id" : "Brouwerij Lefebvre", "avg" : 8.3 }
{ "_id" : "Brouwerij du Bocq voor Corsendonk nv", "avg" : 8.5 }
{ "_id" : "Brouwerij Liefmans", "avg" : 8.5 }
```

### Exercises
* What is the average alcoholpercentage per brewery?
<!---
db.beers.aggregate([
  {$group: {_id: "$brewery", avg: {$avg: "$alcoholpercentage"}}}
])
-->
* Which breweries have an average alcohol percentage higher than 10 degrees? Return these in descending order of alcoholpercentage.
<!---
db.beers.aggregate([
  {$group: {_id: "$brewery", avg:{$avg: "$alcoholpercentage"}}},
  {$match: {avg: {$gt: 10}}},
  {$sort: {avg: -1}}
])
-->
* What is the average alcoholpercentage per type of beer? Sort by alcoholpercentage.
<!---
db.beers.aggregate([
  {$unwind: "$type"},
  {$group: {_id: "$type", avg:{$avg: "$alcoholpercentage"}}},
  {$sort: {avg: -1}}
])
-->
* What is the range (max - min) of alcoholpercentage for beers per brewery that brews more than 1 beer?
<!---
db.beers.aggregate([
  {$group: {_id: "$brewery", percentages: {$push: "$alcoholpercentage"}}},
  {$match: {'percentages.1': {$exists: true}}},
  {$project: {
    brewery: 1,
    min: {$min: "$percentages"},
    max: {$max: "$percentages"}
  }},
  {$project: {
    range: {$subtract: ["$max", "$min"]}
  }},
  {$sort: {range: -1}}
])
-->

## 3. MapReduce in MongoDB

Although `aggregate` in MongoDB is very useful and easy to use, `mapreduce` does provide some more flexibility.

To use mapreduce, you will define two functions: a `map` function and a `reduce` function. See the [hadoop exercise from an earlier post](http://vda-lab.github.io/2016/04/hadoop-tutorial) for a refresher. However, the mongo shell uses javascript rather than python as its language.

So remember: one document looks like this:

    {
      "_id" : ObjectId("57193db714ab80806edea386"),
      "beer" : "Postel Tripel",
      "brewery" : "Affligem Brouwerij",
      "type" : [
        "blonde tripel",
        "abdijbier"
      ],
      "alcoholpercentage" : 8.5
    }

Suppose we want to know the number of beers per brewery.

**1. Define the map function to process each input document**

* In the function, the keyword `this` refers to the document that the map-reduce operation is processing.
* The function maps the number 1 to the `brewery` for each document and emits this pair. The `1` is basically the count of number of beers for that brewery *for that specific document*.

In code for the Mongo shell, this means:

```javascript
var mapFunction1 = function() {
  emit(this.brewery, 1);
};
```

**2. Define the corresponding reduce function with two arguments `brewery` and `counts`:**

When we will run the `mapReduce` command (see **3** below), the values of the `map` function (in this case: the `1`'s) are automatically put in an array before they are handed to the `reduce` function. In other words:

* your `map` function should return something like this:
```
brewery1   1
brewery2   1
brewery3   1
brewery2   1
brewery2   1
brewery3   1
```
* but what your `reduce` function gets, is this:
```
brewery1   [1]
brewery2   [1,1,1]
brewery3   [1,1]
```

So based on this, our `reduce` function should just sum the elements of the value array for each input that it is handed.

```javascript
var reduceFunction1 = function(brewery, values) {
  return Array.sum(values)
}
```

**3. Perform the map-reduce on all documents in the `beers` collection using the `mapFunction1` map function and the `reduceFunction1` reduce function:**

We finally combine the `map` and `reduce` functions using the `mapReduce` function. Note that you need to tell mongo `mapReduce` where to put the results. You can either put them in a new collection, or have them send to the screen.

```javascript
db.beers.mapReduce(
  mapFunction1,
  reduceFunction1,
  { out: "numberBeersPerBrewery" }
)
```

This command will create a new collection named `numberBeersPerBrewery` that will contain the results. To have the output sent to the screen instead, use `{ out: {inline: 1} }` instead.

Debugging tip: to find out if your `map` function does what you expect it would do, write a `reduce` function that does nothing, e.g.

```
var reduceFunctionTest = function(key, values) {
  return {k: key, v: values}
}
```

You can find info about MapReduce in MongoDB here: <http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/core/map-reduce/> and <http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/tutorial/map-reduce-examples/>.

### Exercises

If you followed along, you will now have an additional collection called `numberBeersPerBrewery`.

* Using the `numberBeersPerBrewery` collection that you just generated, get the top-10 of the breweries. How can we sort from high to low?
<!-- db.numberBeersPerBrewery.find().sort({value: -1}).limit(10) -->
* Find all entries in the collection `beersPerBrewery`, that contain the word 'Inbev' in the brewery field. You will probably get 3 results. However, there should be 9. Why? How can you solve that?
<!-- db.numberBeersPerBrewery.find({"_id": /Inbev/i}).count() -->
* Difficult: using a single mapreduce on the `beers` collection, calculate the maximum alcohol percentage per type of beer.
<!---
    var mapFunction2 = function() {
      var beer = this
      beer.type.forEach(function(t) {
        emit(t, beer.alcoholpercentage)
      })
    };

    var reduceFunction2 = function(key, values) {
      return Math.max.apply(null,values)
    }

    db.beers.mapReduce(mapFunction2, reduceFunction2, { out: {inline: 1}})
-->
* Difficult: using a single mapReduce on the `beers` collection, calculate the average alcohol percentage per type of beer. Remember that in order to calculate an average, you will first need a sum and a count. **Hint:** This exercise will require you to define a finalizing step in the MapReduce operation. Revisit the [MongoDB examples](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/tutorial/map-reduce-examples/) if this doesn't ring a bell. Also: watch out: `reduce` will not run if there is only one element for a given key (see [this stackoverflow discussion](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11021733/mongodb-mapreduce-emit-one-key-one-value-doesnt-call-reduce). You'll have to capture this in the finalize step.
<!---
var mapFunction3 = function() {
  var beer = this
  beer.type.forEach(function(t) {
    emit(t, {count: 1, percentage: beer.alcoholpercentage})
  })
}
var reduceFunction3 = function(type, percentages) {
  reducedVal = {count: 0, total: 0}
  percentages.forEach(function(p) {
    reducedVal.count += p.count
    reducedVal.total += p.percentage
  })
  return reducedVal
}
var finalizeFunction3 = function(type, reducedVal) {
  if ('total' in reducedVal) { // We had more than 1 beer for this type
    return reducedVal.total/reducedVal.count
  } else { // use the original percentage
    return reducedVal.percentage
  }
}
db.beers.mapReduce(
  mapFunction3,
  reduceFunction3,
  {out: {inline: 1},
   finalize: finalizeFunction3}
)
-->
