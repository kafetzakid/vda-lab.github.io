# Visualisation #

## Assignment to be performed before the exercise session ##

For the visualization exercises, we will use the [paper.js](http://paperjs.org) library. Paper.js is based on javascript, so you should become acquainted with that language.

To prepare for the visualization exercise session, we would like you to:

* Follow the Javascript course on [Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/javascript).
* Have a look at the tutorials and reference material on [paper.js](http://paperjs.org).
* Using [sketch.paperjs.org](http://sketch.paperjs.org) create a very simple data visualization, e.g. a line-plot or scatterplot of 10 points that you choose at random. Try playing with sizes of points, colours, placement on the screen, etc.
* Replace the code in the `visualization/simple.js` file in your home directory on the server with the code that you wrote in sketch.paperjs.org, so that we can have a look at it during the exercise session itself. You can see if it works by going to [http://50.16.33.38:8000/visualization/index.html](http://50.16.33.38:8000/visualization/index.html) and clicking on your username.

## Exercise ##

*Ryo: we need some help here*

### Design ###

### Coding ###

Take a look at the datasets: where do they come from, what do they represent, how large are they, missing values, etc.

When looking at the datasets: what type of data could be interesting to visualize? Why would you visualize this data?

(optional) If you are not yet familiar with the Linux terminal, the shell or writing simple javascript code, we advise you to experiment with it: take a look already at the excercise below, and start preparing in advance.
Excercise

Create the visualization you came up with during the presentation. A template file has been provided in (a subdirectory of) your home directory on the teaching server. It can be found here:

    ~/visualization/simple.js

You can view the webpage that is rendered using this javascript/paperscript program by pointing your browser to the following url:

    http://50.16.33.38:8000/

You should find you name in the list. Clicking it shows you the result of executing the script in simple.js mentioned above.

You should be able to get a working script that visualizes some aspect of one of the datasets we provided at the end of the excercise session. Keep it simple, but think about why this is something you want to visualize.
