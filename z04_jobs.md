# :: Visualizing text from patient records ::

## Scientific context

Patient records and clinical reports include a vast amount of crucial information that is stored as free text, but that is unstructured and requires a human to make sense of it (e.g. “vague pain in belly which radiates to back”). Research into semantic processing of these texts (“machine reading“) is a hot topic at the moment and aims to not merely extract the individual components of these texts, but actually come to a deeper machine “understanding”, including temporal, spatial and causal structures and relationships.

The ACCUMULATE consortium recently received 4-year funding for “Acquiring Crucial Medical Information Using Language Technology”. Our role in this project is to develop data visualization methods to (a) support the development of the machine reading algorithms, and (b) present the extracted information to the doctor. For the first, we will for example create abstract interactive visualizations showing the effects of using different parameters in the algorithms; the latter will include (but not be limited to) creating visuals that combine the information from the unstructured text with additional information such as episodes, medication, etc.
To do this, we have 2 fully-funded positions available at the moment, for a 4-year PhD student and a 1-year postdoctoral researcher. Both positions will include working with the users, visual design, implementation of data visualizations, and evaluation.

## Requirements

### PhD student

* A strong MSc degree in computer science or design, or a field related to human-computer interaction
* Some experience in visual design or data visualization (e.g. using D3), preferably of text
* Good programming skills (preferably javascript)

### Postdoctoral researcher

* PhD which combines computer science with visual design
* Demonstrably track record in visualization of textual information

## How to apply

To apply, please send an email to jan.aerts@kuleuven.be, and include (preferably in PDF): [a] your CV, [b] two references (with email and phone number), [c] one or more figures and/or screencasts of previous data visualization work.
We will start reviewing applications in October 2015, but applications will be considered until the positions are filled.
