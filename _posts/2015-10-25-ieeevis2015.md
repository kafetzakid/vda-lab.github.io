## LDAV keynote by Alan Keahey

Alan Keahey works at IBM Watson on life science data. His blog is [holisticsofa.com](http://holisticsofa.com). His talk "Playing Scales - Bridging the Gap between Visual Perception and Big Data" gave an overview of at what scales data exist, as well as analysis, visualization, and interaction.

### Limit of perception

Colin Ware states that the **limit of perception** is **4k by 4k**. This means that the limit of display is 4k by 4k is that screen fills your field of view. Bigger screens either require the user to focus on part of the data (if they want to optimally use their perceptual bandwidth), or stand back. When standing back, the user will not see the individual pixels anymore, but perceive clusters of them with an upper resolution of 4k by 4k.

### Framework

Keahey used the Eames "Powers of 10" video as a backdrop to think about different scales of data, analyses, visualizations, and interactions. The problem is that visual encodings (e.g. scatterplot, barchart) live at completely different scales than where the data is (giga- to peta-units). In creating visualizations, you basically have to use methods that can bring that high scale back to one that can be visually encoded. In the picture below, the original large-scale data is brought down using clustering. That converted data is still to large to just plot on the screen (keeping the 4k-by-4k limit in mind). Using pan & zoom, and focus & context, this can be brought down further. So creating a visualization is basically creating a walk through these methods from high to low scale.

### Interaction scalability

When talking about different types of interaction scalability, Keahey mentioned focus & context, pan & zoom and logical interaction. However, he also pointed out what is very often overlooked, which is **available user time**. In a research context users can spend time learning how to use a custom information-rich visualization. This is completely different from the clinical environment, where user-time is very limited and simple visualizations are key.

Interesting quote: "When talking about big data, I don't talk about the 3 Vs; that puts people asleep. 3 Vs are actually 3 Zs."
