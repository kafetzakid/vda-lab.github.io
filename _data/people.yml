  bio: |
    Jan has a background in genetics and genomics, and performed his doctoral research at the University of Wageningen (Netherlands) on the Chicken Genome Sequencing Project. He then moved to Scotland to work as a postdoctoral researcher at the Roslin Institute on the Cow Genome Sequencing Project. Next, he continued his research at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute near Cambridge (UK) focusing on structural variation in the human and other primate genomes. At his return to Belgium in 2010, he shifted focus to data visualization and visual analytics, with the aim of finding interesting questions in large datasets (big data). His main research topics revolve around visual design, interaction design, and (human and computational) scalability. He collects inspiration for (both good and bad) visualizations on his pinterest board.

    Jan is on the organizing committees of BioVis and Beyond The Genome, and has chaired visualization-related sessions at conferences including VIZBI, the Bioinformatics Open Source Conference BOSC and EuroVis/VMLS. He is also Associate Editor for the BioMedCentral Thematic Series on Biological Data Visualization, and academic editor for PLoS One. He is member of the Young Academy – Royal Flemish Academy of Belgium for Sciences and the Arts.

    Thomas has a background in computer science. His research focus is using visual analytics on location data to enable insight generation. This has many applications, for example early identification of illegal activity at sea or improving people flow in a train station. This project is a collaboration between KULeuven and Luciad. Thomas has worked for 8 years as an R&D software engineer at Luciad, designing and realizing a high-performance visualization library for geospatial data. Through this research Luciad wants to scale its technology to the huge amount of location data available today.

    Jaume is a free knowledge advocate who works in the intersection of art, science and technology. More specifically, he is interested in the interface between human beings and reality, that is, data visualization. He studied how to combine natural text collections analysis, visualization, and exploration techniques. With a background in sciences (chemistry), he worked as a researcher in media art in Ars Electronica (Austria), and in  development projects as engineer (Angola, Kenya, and Pakistan). In 2010 he moved to academic research (Catalonia and Australia). His current interests (2015) are: big collections of texts, interface simplicity, visual uncertainty, and technology adoption.
