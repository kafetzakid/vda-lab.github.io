<h2 id="assignment-to-be-performed-before-the-exercise-session">Assignment to be performed before the exercise session</h2>

<p>For the visualization exercises, we will use the <a href="http://paperjs.org">paper.js</a> library. Paper.js is based on javascript, so you should become acquainted with that language.</p>

<p>The following links can help in preparing:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Follow the Javascript course on <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/javascript">Codecademy</a>.</li>
  <li>Have a look at the tutorials and reference material on <a href="http://paperjs.org">paper.js</a>, especially the parts “Paths (Working with Path Items, Creating Predefined Shapes, and Using Color and Style)” and “Geometry (Point, Size and Rectangle)”.</li>
</ul>

<p>The preparation assignment consists of two parts.</p>

<h3 id="part-1-bad-data-visualization-example">Part 1: Bad data visualization example</h3>

<p>Search literature and/or the internet to find an example of bad data visualization. <strong>Upload the picture to Toledo.</strong> During the exercise session itself, some of you will be asked to come to the front and explain what is wrong with the visualization.</p>

<h3 id="part-2-paperjs-implementation">Part 2: Paper.js implementation</h3>

<p>Get acquainted with paper.js - paper.js is a data visualization library to create custom data visualizations.</p>

<p>The following code displays a scatterplot using paper.js:</p>

<p>```
var data = [
    {x:345,y:30,z:445,colour:”green”,size:4},
    {x:475,y:305,z:390,colour:”blue”,size:16},
    {x:430,y:50,z:305,colour:”green”,size:2},
    {x:85,y:295,z:260,colour:”yellow”,size:14},
    {x:465,y:120,z:460,colour:”red”,size:2},
    {x:105,y:110,z:190,colour:”blue”,size:6},
    {x:215,y:220,z:325,colour:”red”,size:16},
    {x:480,y:430,z:415,colour:”red”,size:10},
    {x:105,y:210,z:35,colour:”blue”,size:22},
    {x:415,y:475,z:15,colour:”green”,size:16}
]</p>

<p>// Draw the axes
var yAxis = new Path.Line(new Point(10,10), new Point(10,500))
yAxis.strokeColor = ‘black’
var xAxis = new Path.Line(new Point(10,500), new Point(500,500))
xAxis.strokeColor = ‘black’</p>

<p>// Draw the datapoints
for ( var i = 0; i &lt; data.length; i++ ) {
    var size = 5
    var circle = new Path.Circle(new Point(data[i].x, data[i].y), size)
    circle.fillColor = data[i].colour
    console.log(data[i].x + “ - “ + data[i].colour)
}
```</p>

<p>You can copy/paste this code into <a href="http://sketch.paperjs.org">sketch.paperjs.org</a> to check if it works and try out some simple changes such as changing the color and size of the dots based on the data.</p>

<p>You can see that the data has 3 dimensions (x, y and z), but only 2 are shown in the scatterplot. Your assignment is to at least <strong>make a parallel coordinates plot that shows all 3 dimensions</strong>. If you desire you can add additional subplots such as a histogram for each of the dimensions, etc. Feel free to be creative!</p>

<p>When the code works, copy it into the file ~/visualization/simple.js in your home directory on the server. That will make it viewable via <a href="http://50.16.33.38:8000/exercises/visualization/index.html">http://50.16.33.38:8000/exercises/visualization/index.html</a> and clicking on your username. Deadline to put it there: the morning of the exercise session at 9am.</p>

<h2 id="exercise-session">Exercise Session</h2>

<p>During the exercise session, you will be given a visualization. In groups, you will discuss what aspects of this visualization are good and bad and come up with possible improvements.</p>

<p>Each group will then present its analysis.</p>
