Blog: http://saaientist.blogspot.com

Bio – Jan has a background in genetics and genomics, and performed his doctoral research at the University of Wageningen (Netherlands) on the Chicken Genome Sequencing Project. He then moved to Scotland to work as a postdoctoral researcher at the Roslin Institute on the Cow Genome Sequencing Project. Next, he continued his research at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute near Cambridge (UK) focusing on structural variation in the human and other primate genomes. At his return to Belgium in 2010, he shifted focus to data visualization and visual analytics, with the aim of finding interesting questions in large datasets (big data). His main research topics revolve around visual design, interaction design, and (human and computational) scalability. He collects inspiration for (both good and bad) visualizations on his pinterest board.
Jan is on the organizing committees of BioVis and Beyond The Genome, and has chaired visualization-related sessions at conferences including VIZBI, the Bioinformatics Open Source Conference BOSC and EuroVis/VMLS. He is also Associate Editor for the BioMedCentral Thematic Series on Biological Data Visualization, and academic editor for PLoS One. He is member of the Young Academy – Royal Flemish Academy of Belgium for Sciences and the Arts.

Bio – Thomas is a PhD student at both the Universiteit Antwerpen and KU Leuven (joint PhD).
His PhD research focuses on scalable implementations of interactive visualization and
analysis tools for hypothesis-free exploration of complex data.
Thomas worked as a software engineering and architecture consultant in a broad spectrum
of industries, where he built systems ranging from back-end data systems to mobile apps.
With more than a decade’s worth of battle scars as a professional programmer, he
seeks to apply his experience in the scientific domain. He is a strong advocate of
the functional programming paradigm.
Thomas obtained a Master’s degree in Informatics in 2002 and an Advanced Master’s
degree in Artificial Intelligence in 2003 at the KU Leuven.

### :: Daniel Alcaide ::

PhD student

Bio – Daniel Alcaide is a PhD student at the Department of Electrical Engineering at KU Leuven. He conducts research in interactive visualisation and data analysis to bring insight into large and complex data. He worked as a statistician in various areas related to clinical development in Barcelona where he learned about the power of visual representation to communicate information.
Daniel obtained a Master’s in Statistics and Operational Research at Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya in 2012 and a Master’s in Visual Analytics and Big Data at Universidad Internacional de la Rioja in 2015.

### :: Jansi Thiyagarajan ::

PhD student

![Photo Jansi]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/photo_jansi.jpg)

Bio – Jansi has a techno-functional background. She obtained her Bachelor degree in Electrical Engineering from Anna University in India and a Master degree in International Business from ESC Grenoble in France. She started her career as a marketer and then moved to the area of commercial data analytics owing to her interest in making sense of data to drive business. She strongly believes that visualisation is the most effective way to communicate the insights and finds it exciting to visualise data from different domains. Her current research focuses on visualising genomic and healthcare data.
