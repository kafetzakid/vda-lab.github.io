title: Visualizing dosage-related drug response for L1000 data - a design exercise
permalink: flyplot.html
---
Collaboration with Bang Wong, Broad Institute

The L1000 project (now available through [http://clue.io](http://clue.io); see [this paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24906883) for data browser) investigates how small molecules perturb gene expression with the aim to identify novel drug targets. The data basically consists of gene expressions in different types of cells (normal vs cancer) for different dosages of the small molecules.

In an exercise to visualize this large dataset on paper (A0 poster) rather than interactively on a screen, Ryo Sakai developed the Fly Plot. This paper representation allowed for a more engaging and more effective discussion between domain experts.

The initial iterations of this visual followed the effectiveness principle as shown in Figure 1 and were good at representing the data very accurately (see Figure 2-A), especially when skewing the y-axis to reduce the visual noise (Figure 2-B). After some interactions, we adopted a radial plot approach and named this new visual encoding "Fly plot", since it looked like fly fishing flies. The fly plot allowed to draw more visual emphasis on those responses with stronger effect, especially effects measured at two different doses. Â These plots were effective to have the researchers look at different expression pattern of dosage effect and find interesting patterns and compare between drugs.

This visualization exercise is a clear example of the tension between generic versus custom visual designs. Although generic visualizations (scatterplot, barchart, etc) in generic tools (Excel, Tableau, R, but also e.g. generic genome browsers such as the Ensembl Browser) are very useful for a greater user group, these often don't suffice for specific questions or when the data is very complex (see Figure 4).

In addition, Ryo stepped away from following the effectiveness principle blindly (Figure 2 A and B) but rather focused on maximixing the pop-out effect (i.e. preattentive vision) to quickly draw the attention of the viewer to interesting patterns (see Figure 5).
