## General setup of the course

For each of the topics, we typically have a lecture and an exercise session. Before the exercise session, we also expect you do do an assignment so that you're well-prepared for the exercises.

We will constantly refer back to 3 different datasets within this course, to show which of the technologies discussed fits a certain use of a dataset best. For a description of these datasets, see [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/teaching/i0u19a/datasets.html).
