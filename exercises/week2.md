# Visualization Assignment #

## Bad visualizations

Search literature and/or the internet to find an example of bad data visualization. Upload the picture to Toledo. 

During the exercise session itself, some of the students will be asked to come to the front and explain what is wrong with the visualization.

Deadline is **9am the morning of the exercise session** so that we have the opportunity to review the figures before the exercise session starts and adapt the contents of that session accordingly if necessary.


## Prep next session

This Thursday, we will build some data visualizations from scratch. The toolkit we'll use for this is **Processing** (available at [processing.org](processing.org)).

I wrote a tutorial on Processing that is now available in the "Course Documents" on Toledo, and we'll walk together through this document during the exercise session. 

However, the 2 hours of the session are not sufficient to handle everything in the tutorial. Therefore, I'd like to ask you to do the first part on your own: please go through the tutorial until page 11 (up to "Interactivity and defining functions") before the start of our session on Thursday. In the exercise session itself, we will not look at these pages anymore, and start straight from page 11.
