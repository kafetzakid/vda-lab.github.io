For the treatment of HIV different drug classes exist that are used in antiretroviral therapy (ART). Our focus is on three of these drug classes, i.e. the protease inhibitors (PI), nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) and non-nucleoside transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI). Because of the high mutation rate in HIV, the virus can quickly develop resistance against these drugs. This is why a combination of different classes is usually prescribed which makes the ART a highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART).

In developed countries, approximately 10% of drug naïve individuals (i.e. individuals that haven't received treatment yet with a specific drug type) are newly infected with HIV-1 already carrying transmitted drug resistance (TDR), which can be a problem for ﬁrst line therapy decisions. Recently diagnosed patients are mostly chronically infected, and major drug resistance mutations (DRMs) tend to reverse in the absence of the therapy, thus not all drug resistance mutations present are detectable even when TDR has been found. Whether transmitted directly from treated patients (primary acquisition), or onwards from untreated patients with TDR (secondary acquisition), makes a difference in the ﬁrst line treatment. In absence of drug selective pressure, DRMs tend to disappear in the circulating virus because of their ﬁtness cost for the virus, but remain archived in the body, while minor resistance mutations persist. Therefore, only those with onward-transmitted TDR are not expected to carry minority resistant variants and can properly be counseled using TDR. This knowledge urges us to track the prevalence and dynamics of TDR, and to investigate the sources of TDR, other drug naïve patients or treated patients with resistance.

In Southern Portugal many hospitals are working together to create a database of HIV sequences from their patients. In this database currently 6500 HIV-1 sequences are available of which ~3400 are subtype B and of those ~3000 are from treated patients (with one or more drug classes) and ~1600 from drug naïve (for one or more classes) patients.

A phylogenetic tree was made from these sequences and in this tree the transmission clusters were identified depending on different thresholds for genetic distance between the samples and bootstrap support. Most of the clusters that were identified are between two patients but some have more than 2 patients as can be seen in the following table (clusters with bootstrap support of > 90% and genetic distance between samples < 0.015).

| drug class | clusters | same patient | DN-DN | >= 2 | TR-DN | >= 2 |
|------------|----------|--------------|-------|------|-------|------|
| PI         | 121      | 65           | 8     | 2    | 19    | 0    |
| NRTI       | 306      | 177          | 17    | 5    | 19    | 2    |
| NNRTI      | 69       | 18           | 5     | 2    | 20    | 3    |

Depending on the thresholds of genetic distance and bootstrap support, we get a different number of transmission clusters as can be seen in the following graph.

When we look at the entire database for drug resistance we find 187 cases of TDR (11.6%) with 4% resistant to PIs, 5.1% resistant to NRTIs and 6% resistant to NNRTIs. Resistance against a single drug class was observed in 8.9% of the samples, 2.3% showed resistance to two classes and 0.4% showed resistance against all three classes.

Counting the number of transmission clusters that consist of only drug naïve patients and those that consist of both treated and drug naïve patients, we see that in the case of NRTIs the number of clusters with only drug naïves is as high as the number of clusters with both treated and drug naïves. In the other cases (PIs and NNRTIs) the number of clusters with only drug naïves is lower. Because of the lower coverage of sequences from drug naïve patients (estimated 15%) in the database compared to the treated ones (estimated 60%), it is still difficult to conclusively say that drug resistance is transmitted mainly between drug naïves. Taking the coverage into account, the numbers for the NRTIs do suggest transmission mainly between drug naïves and when extrapolating the numbers for the other drug classes to simulate a complete coverage, we see the same trends.
