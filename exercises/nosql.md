# Exercise 1: Document Databases (MongoDB)

Follow [the tutorial](http://try.mongodb.org/) on <http://try.mongodb.org/> and have a chance at winning a T-shirt or mug from mongoDB.

More information on how updates work in MongoDB [can be found here](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/core/crud-introduction/): <http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/core/crud-introduction/>.


# Exercise 2: Graph Databases (Neo4J)

Learn about the Cypher language for querying Neo4J [here](http://www.neo4j.org/learn/cypher): <http://www.neo4j.org/learn/cypher>. Go through the different steps.

You don't _have_ to do the last step (installation of Neo4J), but you're obviously free to do so if you want to.


# Exercise 3: Application

Remember the different [datasets](datasets.html) we introduced earlier? We used these datasets to run RDBMS queries.

We now turn the question around: **For the 3 datasets each, write down a question that fits nicely with each of 3 database technologies: RDBMS, Document based and Graph DBs.**

What you should get is a table like this where every cell contains a question that can be answered about the respective dataset by using a the given database technology.

                   **drugs**     **beer**    **genotype**
--------------    -----------   ----------  --------------
 **RDBMS**                                   
 **Document**                                
 **Graph**                                   
----------------------------------------------------------

The questions for every combination, as well as a short description of how you would want to tackle the problem can be put on Toledo.
