## MSc thesis topics

Here's a list of available MSc thesis topics in the lab.

* [Visualization of fMRI data]({{ site.baseurl }}/teaching/thesis/fMRI.pdf) - available
* **Insight into relevant features in dynamic models** (w/ Panos Patrinos) - The relevant features in a dynamic model depend on the state of the system at a specific point in time. Feature selection is therefore inherently different from static models, as the feature ranking changes constantly. We might be able to use data visualization to gain insight in which features are relevant under changing circumstances, and to what extent the system is sensitive to them.
* **Parameter space and system state** (w/ Panos Patrinos) - The state of a system can depend on many parameters. These parameters might be dependent on each other (in a linear or non-linear way). In this project, the student will develop interactive data visualizations to explore this dependency.
