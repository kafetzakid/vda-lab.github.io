We don't have specific open positions available at the moment. However, we do welcome inquiries regarding PhD or postdoc research if these address major questions in visual data analysis (e.g. visual design, computational or perceptual scalability, interaction with the expert user). In case of a good fit we can apply for specific funding for this.

## :: Visualizing text from patient records ::

### Scientific context

Patient records and clinical reports include a vast amount of crucial information that is stored as free text, but that is unstructured and requires a human to make sense of it (e.g. “vague pain in belly which radiates to back”). Research into semantic processing of these texts (“machine reading“) is a hot topic at the moment and aims to not merely extract the individual components of these texts, but actually come to a deeper machine “understanding”, including temporal, spatial and causal structures and relationships.

The ACCUMULATE consortium recently received 4-year funding for “Acquiring Crucial Medical Information Using Language Technology”. Our role in this project is to develop data visualization methods to (a) support the development of the machine reading algorithms, and (b) present the extracted information to the doctor. For the first, we will for example create abstract interactive visualizations showing the effects of using different parameters in the algorithms; the latter will include (but not be limited to) creating visuals that combine the information from the unstructured text with additional information such as episodes, medication, etc.
To do this, we have 2 fully-funded positions available at the moment, for a 4-year PhD student and a 1-year postdoctoral researcher. Both positions will include working with the users, visual design, implementation of data visualizations, and evaluation.

### Requirements

#### PhD student

* A strong MSc degree in computer science or design, or a field related to human-computer interaction
* Some experience in visual design or data visualization (e.g. using D3), preferably of text
* Good programming skills (preferably javascript)

#### Postdoctoral researcher

* PhD which combines computer science with visual design
* Demonstrably track record in visualization of textual information

### How to apply

To apply, please send an email to jan.aerts@kuleuven.be, and include (preferably in PDF): [a] your CV, [b] two references (with email and phone number), [c] one or more figures and/or screencasts of previous data visualization work.
We will start reviewing applications in October 2015, but applications will be considered until the positions are filled.

## :: MECOVI - Medical Collaborative Visualization ::
**Did you ever want to use your design background to save lives?** We're hiring!

Cancer- and epilepsy-patients as well as early-born babies are a few examples of people who are in the care of entire teams of specialists, ranging from radiologists and oncologists to cardiologists, neurologists and other -ologists. Communication between these experts is of course crucial, but the tools that they use for this often date from the stone age (powerpoint with screenshots, for example.)

We want to change that.

In collaboration with companies such as Barco, which develops big screen hardware, we want to focus on the design/visualization-end of these interactions. Some questions that we would like to answer include: To what extent can data from one field be abstracted so that an expert in another field can still understand it? What would a good interactive expert-oriented visual overview look like that can be used as a scaffold to attach more detailed information? Can we find a way to gracefully degrade that overview in settings where one of the collaborators works remotely on a small or low-resolution screen? Can we integrate for example neurology data with cardiology?

But we need your help...

If you have a design background and know your way around user-driven design and programming data visualizations using [Processing](http://processing.org) or [D3](http://d3js.org), you may be the person we are looking for. If you're interested to play a role, please send an email to jan.aerts@kuleuven.be, and include (preferably in PDF): [a] your CV, [b] two references (with email and phone number), [c] one or more figures and/or screencasts of previous data visualization work. Please mention "MECOVI" in your application. We'd like to find someone by February...

In case you have an MSc, the position is initially for 15 months, but if we're a good match additional funding will be sought to prolong this for a full PhD study. Postdoctoral researchers are free to apply as well, but in that case funding will be for a shorter period.

## :: MyHealthData - Empowering the patient ::
In the old days, all information relevant to a patient would have been hand-written on pieces of paper stored in the doctor's office. Things have changed. Not only is there the electronic patient record containing an individual's full history, but a lot of other relevant information is available such as medical guidelines, aggregated characteristics of comparable patients, and projections into the future. **Wouldn't it be nice if we could let patients/citizens give full access to and insight in their own data?** We believe so...

In collaboration with different Belgian content providers (electronic health record providers, caregivers, health insurers, ...) we want to build tools to unlock this information to the patient. This will involve data analytics, visualization, and user experience research. To help us in this effort, we are looking to hire a **data scientist** versed in the field of data visualization but also not shy to perform data analysis. Specific topics that will be covered include (but will not be limited to) data exploration, improving interpretability of black-box machine learning algorithms, and development of privacy-aware visual encodings.

So if you're a data scientist who not only knows how to cluster datasets but also how to design visualizations (e.g. using [Processing](http://processing.org) or [D3](http://d3js.org), you might be the person we're looking for. If you're interested to play a role in this project, please send an email to jan.aerts@kuleuven.be, and include (preferably in PDF): [a] your CV, [b] two references (with email and phone number), [c] if available, one or more figures and/or screencasts of previous data visualization work. Please mention "MyHealthData" in your application. We'd like to find someone by February...

If you have an MSc, the position is originally available for 2 years, but in case of a good match additional funding will be sought for PhD study. If you're a postdoctoral researcher, you're welcome to apply as well, although the funded period will initially be shorter.

## :: Virogenesis - Advanced phylogeny visualization ::
Viruses are the cause of many common human diseases, from the not-so-serious as common cold and cold sores, to the very-serious like HIV and Ebola. Unfortunately, the **tools to identify and follow the spread of these viruses leave a lot to be improved**. In the European Virogenesis project, we want to change this by building the bioinformatics tools to diagnose viral diseases, monitor their evolution within patients, and track viral outbreaks (think "Ebola").

Therefore, we are looking to hire a **PhD student** to focus on the **visualization** aspects of this project. This includes (but will not be limited to) addressing scalability, uncertainty, and interactivity of phylogenetic trees. In addition, we need to devise ways to combine these trees with for example geo-location data, and find visual encodings to represent changes in viromes.

Initial funding is available for 3 years. Additional funding will be sought to extend this to 4 full years. Postdoctoral researchers are welcome to apply as well, but initial funding will be for a shorter period.

Are you interested in helping us out and have a background in omics data analysis and/or data visualization (e.g. using [Processing](http://processing.org) or [D3](http://d3js.org)? If so, please send an email to jan.aerts@kuleuven.be, and include (preferably in PDF): [a] your CV, [b] two references (with email and phone number), [c] if available, one or more figures and/or screencasts of previous data visualization work. Please mention "Virogenesis" in your application.

## :: GeoPatterns - Visual analytics in geolocation data ::
Imagine being an air traffic controller and wanting to know if a plane is not following the route it should be following. Or imagine being a maritime law enforcement officer and wanting to identify which ships in the Indian ocean might be pirate ships. This is surprisingly difficult to do, because you can't always know beforehand what to look for. This is where **geo-spatial data visualization** comes in, showing the trajectories of these planes or ships on a map in combination with additional data.

But is it that simple? No. How can you find that one ship that you're interested in amongst the thousands of ships on your screen? In this project, we would like to develop visual analytics techniques for easy **identification of "abnormal" behaviour in geo-spatial data**, in collaboration with [Luciad](http://www.luciad.com), a Leuven-based company specialized in situational awareness that helps their users to gain insight in large time-dependent geo-spatial data.

*Ship movements at port of Rotterdam. van de Laar et al, Situation Awareness with Systems of Systems*

Therefore, Luciad and our lab are looking to **hire a PhD researcher** under the conditions of a [IWT Baekeland grant](http://www.iwt.be/english/funding/subsidy/BM), which is a personal scholarship assigned to you. The research would be in very close collaboration with Luciad.

So if you're a data scientist who has some background in machine learning (clustering, ...) and is interested in learning to create interactive data visualizations (e.g. using [Processing](http://processing.org) or [D3](http://d3js.org), you might be the person we're looking for. If you're interested to play a role in this project, please send an email to jan.aerts@kuleuven.be (cc to bart.adams@luciad.com), and include (preferably in PDF): [a] your CV, [b] two references (with email and phone number), [c] if available, one or more figures and/or screencasts of previous data visualization work. Please mention "GeoPattern" in your application. Deadline for the grant proposal submission is beginning of March, which means we need someone in the first half of February. The grant procedure includes an **oral defense in Brussels by the candidate**, so it helps if you're from Belgium or not that far away.

## :: ScienceWithoutBorders - Visualizing genomic structural variation ::
For years, we thought that single small changes in the DNA (single nucleotide polymorphisms) were the main actors in what distinguished the diseased from the healthy, the susceptible from the resistant. But now it becomes more and more clear that larger **structural genomic variations** (insertions, deletions, inversions and translocations) play an important role as well. Why were these hidden for so long? Because the data is more difficult to find and analyze. Nevertheless, their analysis comes more and more under pressure because people start looking at the single-cell level, for example to see how tumours evolve over time.

To help the analysis and interpretation of this type of data, we need to work on methods for **visually representing these variations**. And for that, we are looking to hire a **PhD student** under the Brazilian [Science Without Borders](http://www.cienciasemfronteiras.gov.br/web/csf-eng/) (Ciência sem fronteiras) umbrella.

Funding for this project is provided by the Brazilian government, which means that only people with the **Brazilian nationality** can apply.

Do you have the Brazilian nationality? And do you have a background in data visualization (*e.g.* using [Processing](http://processing.org) or [D3](http://d3js.org)), or know your way in genome analysis? Then you might be the person we're looking for. If you're interested, please send an email to jan.aerts@kuleuven.be, and include (preferably in PDF): [a] your CV, [b] two references (with email and phone number), [c] if available, one or more figures and/or screencasts of previous data visualization work. Please mention "ScienceWithoutBorders" in your application.
